Welcome to Hive 4.x, the publicly available version of Hive.


Hive is a toolbox for post-processing ab-initio data obtained from the VASP
program. The set of incorporated tools has grown over a period of more than
10 years, and is still expanding. With version 4, the code is receiving a much
needed overhaul, which includes a clean-up of existing code, making it suitable
for other users. As a result, Hive 4.x does not include all functionality of
Hive 3.x, but we hope to get there at some point in the future.

To get an overview of the currently implemented options, you can consult the
'help'-function of this manual.
> hive4.exe help

To obtain help-information on a specific topic/tool/command you can append a '?'
to the specific keyword. E.g.:
> hive4.exe NMR?
to find out more on the NMR keyword.

Command to extract NMR data from a VASP output file, and transform
it into data to plot using grace or excel.

The command line option runs as follows:
   > Hive.exe NMR OUTCAR SETTINGS

 with :
   - OUTCAR     an OUTCAR formatted file containing the NMR data.
   - SETTINGS   a text-file containing the parameters to use:
       * INCLUDE_G    : Logical indicating if the G=0 contribution is
                        included. [DEFAULT = .TRUE. ]
       * INCLUDE_CORE : Logical indicating if the core contribution is
                        included. [DEFAULT = .TRUE. ]
       * SHAPE : Peak-shape choice.(Delta, Gaussian) [DEFAULT = Gaussian]
       * SIGMA : Peak width of Gaussian shaped peaks. One value per atomic
                 species (POSCAR definition). [\b DEFAULT = 1 ppm]
       * SHIFT : Do the NMR peaks need to be shifted? [DEFAULT = No]
                + No      : No shifting.
                + Species : One value per atomic species
                + Atom    : One value for each separate atom.
       * SHIFT_VALUE : real valued shift(s) in ppm if Shift is not "No".
                        [DEFAULT = 0.0]
       * STEPSIZE    : real valued step-size of the grid on which the
                        spectrum is presented [DEFAULT = 0.1 (ppm)]
