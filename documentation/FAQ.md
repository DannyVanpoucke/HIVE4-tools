###<a name="IsitFree"> 1. Is HIVE-4 Free </a>
Indeed, HIVE-4 is free to use for any acadmic user. I only ask, as an academic courtesy
to cite the related publication whenever you publish results obtained with this software.
You can find the relevant publications both on the github documentation as well as the 
in-program manual.

###<a name="Opensource"> 2. Why is HIVE-4 not open source?</a>
This program makes extended use of Object Oriented Fortran (imagine classes and factories 
in fortran :-) [cf. my tutorials](https://dannyvanpoucke.be/fortran-tutorials-en/) ) so very 
few will actually be able to figure out what it is doing. Second, and more importantly,
I do not have the time to maintain this program as an open source project.

###<a name="1yrlic"> 3. Why is the licence only valid 1 year?</a> 
It is a lazy way of making sure you use the most recent version of the program, and thus 
the one with the "fewest" bugs. ;-). And since the prgram is free, and installation is just
a copy/past action, installing a new version is as simple as replacing the old files.

###<a name="citepub"> 4. Do I need to cite any specific publication?</a> 
As an academic courtesy, I would like to ask you to cite the relevant publication if
and when you publish results obtained using my program. You can find the relevant 
publications both on the github documentation as well as the in-program manual.

###<a name="bugfind"> 5. I found a bug.</a> 
In case you encounter a bug (of any kind) please inform me by creating an issue. 
Please check if no-one else already posted an issue, in which case please add your
