# HIVE-tools v4.x
Post-processing tool-set for *ab-intio* calculations obtained with [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/).

## History
Version 4.x of the HIVE-toolbox is the public version of the HIVE-toolbox version 3.x 
(the development version). The program is called HIVE which stands for **H**umble **I**nterface 
for **V**asp output**E**diting, which traces back to its original purpose. This software was
developed part as hobby-project, part as a necessary toolbox for analyzing first-principles
results during various scientific projects. During its first incarnation (2005-2009), 
the program consisted simply of the combination of multiple small fortran 95 tools 
through a common main loop. During a second incarnation (starting end 2009) the functions and 
subroutines were upgraded to take a more object-like approach (Fortran 2003 classes). At the
same time, a doxygen documentation was included. Over the following years the program was 
further extended to include more and more functionality. With the advent of version 4, I aim
to make the program publicly available, while at the same time clean up the code.<sup>[1](#ftnote1)</sup>

<a name="ftnote1">1</a> Note that not a single part of the program was developed as subject 
of a funded scientific project. This has the unfortunate side-effect that too often code is 
implemented to work for the problem at hand. With the intended cleanup, some of the issues 
for more general problems will be resolved.
